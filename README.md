To measure the color gamut, it need a specific device which is called color meter. while for most company they only have a brightness meter that can measure the 
brightness and the color coordinates. So the code here is to teach the company with only brightness meter to measure the color gamut.

The theory is that, the color gamut is the LED display's R,G,B
